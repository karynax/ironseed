-1	Puppet1> Look everybody, ^Bob^ has finally come back. I told you that he would.
-1	Puppet2> That isn't Bob! It's the ^D'pahk^! They followed us... They have come down to finish us off!
-1	Puppet3> Nonsense, no one can follow a ^phase^ drive ship. It will take them cycles to get this far.
-1	Puppet1> Hi Bob. We have been waiting for you.
-1	Puppet2> Don't talk to them, they will blast you!
-1	Puppet4> Let's all have a party and discuss this.
-1	Puppet5> Regulation 715.36G of the ^PMC^ forbids party relations with any potentially hostile race.
-1	Puppet4> They aren't hostile... look.
-1	Puppet2> They fired on us... They shot us _out of the sky... No they aren't hostile, they are just _out for blood! I say we blast them while we still can!
-1	Puppet4> Maybe we could take them ^home^ with us.
-1	Puppet1> Bob, lets go ^play^.
-1	Puppet6> Greetings, we are the ^Phaedor Moch^.

1	Puppet3> We can't blast them. Almost all systems are offline or in need of ^repair^.
1	Puppet4> Maybe we could take them ^home^ with us.
1	Puppet3> Without some quick repairs, we aren't going home.
1	Puppet1> Bob, lets go ^play^.

-1	P2> Does it look like we need help?
-1	P4> But they're just being friendly.
-1	P2> Yeah... So they can get close and blast us!
@-1	20007   1       3       HELP ASSISTANCE
3       P6> (whispering) Can you supply us with a coolant and a radioactive?
6       P2> You dirty worms think that you can just follow us here to finish us off... Well you aren't...
6	P3> They don't appear to be worms.
6	P2> Let's blast them anyway, they look dangerous.
8       P1> They aren't much fun, Bob. All they want to talk about is making quick bucks.
8	P2> They are lying cheats... They should be blasted.
8	P3> And they aren't very good engineers either.
10      P2> Don't listen to them... They will try to catch you and sell you as Tarcannian slaves.
25      P5> Regulations prevent revealing any information on our homeworld.
25	P2> Yea... So buzz off, before we have to blast you.
26      P2> We have nothing of interest to trade with you... Now if you will kindly leave, or we will have to blast you.
26	P5> Regulation 677.5 prohibits threats you are unable to carry through with at all trade conferences.
30      P2> (whispering) Anybody says anything and I will personally take your head off.
30	P3> Whatever are you talking about... We have never heard of one of those.
30	P1> But they sure are cool to play with, aren't they Bob.
32      P3> Isn't that what you grow iron donuts _out of?
36      P1> You know who you are, Bob. You have been waiting since the big ^sneeze^ to come among us and ^play^ "punt the snarf".
36	P2> Will you shut up!
36	P6> (whispering) He still believes in the Kaper Fairy too.
37      P5> The PMC forbids disclosure of it's nature to non-aligned entities.
37	P6> (whispering) It is our ruling counsel.
38      P4> Yeah, you can come home with us for a real party.
38	P2> Are you mad?! Invite the enemy to our front door!  We might as well just blast ourselves!

500     -1      3       -1      PLAY PUNT SNARF @PUNTING
-1      P1> Yes, we will all punt the snarf, and whoever punts the loudest becomes the new Bob.
-1	P5> ^PMC^ regulations prohibit snarf punting with potentially hostile races.
-1	P4> Then let's just invite them _over for a cup of tea.

-1      -1      3       39      PLAY PUNT SNARF @PUNTING
39      P1> Yes, we will all punt the snarf, and whoever punts the loudest becomes the new Bob.
39	P5> ^PMC^ regulations prohibit snarf punting on board disabled vessels.
39	P4> Then let's just invite them _over for a cup of tea.

40	P3> Nonsense, the universe was created by a big smack.
40	P2> Shut up and blast them!

1101     -1      3       -1      REPAIR
-1	P3> We need no repairs. All systems are functioning fine.
-1	P2> Yeah, so buzz off before we blast you...
500      -1      3       -1      REPAIR
-1	P3> We require no further _help in our repairs.
-1	P2> Yeah, so buzz off before we blast you...
-1      -1      3       41      REPAIR
41      P3> Many systems are down. We need coolant and a radioactive or else I can't do anything to repair the ship.
41	P6> (whispering) Please, ^help^ us.

42      P6> (whispering) 6 of us were not always. ^Before^, I was the ^controller^, the rational thinker. The others were just voices in my head, parts of our personality. Now, we can no longer control myself, or even suppress them without
42      a large effort. It is so tiring to hold them back. I usually find that it is best to not even remind them that I am here.
43      P6> (whispering) I can't say the ^word^ or they shall surely hear me. Suffice it to say, the phaedor moch were once the most technologically advanced race in the galaxy. We used the ^guild^ to sell our wares
43      abroad. The guild reverse engineered some of our weapons, and built cheap copies to sell to hostile nations. When the weapons didn't work properly, the nations decided to attack our homeworld. We had developed an experimental ^engine^
43      that would fold our world into itself. The engine accentuated the wave characteristic of matter and attenuated the particle characteristic. It could then adjust the phase of the matter so that all of
43      the energy cancelled... thus, using minimal energy for transmission. At the other end, they were demodulated and sent back to material format. When we learned of the 
43      hostile races coming for us, we used the engine on our homeworld... We are a peaceful people and we didn't want war. Unfortunately, using the engine on such a large scale was a disaster.
43      The planet moved, but our personalities were not fused back together at the other end. We were all left together. Together we were left. Now, nothing's right. 
44      P2> Phase drive?
44	P4> So much for any fun now.
44	P2> Hey, it was Puppet6 again... Everybody get him.
45      P6> (whisper) The creative, childlike self.
46      P6> (whisper) The violent, destructive, nontrusting self.  He is dangerous and very controlling.  I worry that he will become dominant.
46	P2> I hear something... Everyone, blast anyone who is speaking _out of turn.
47      P6> (whisper) The logical scientific side.
48      P6> (whisper) The trusting side.
49      P6> (whisper) The official side... always paying attention to duty.
50      P6> (whisper) The controlling, balanced side... all of the others blend to make me. together, we are whole. Apart... well, I don't care to imagine.

-1	P3> Excellent!
-1	P1> I knew you would do it Bob!
-1	P2> They must have booby trapped that cargo! Blast it now while we still can!
-1	P4> Why would they do that? They're giving us gifts.
-1	P2> They want to trick us, blast those supplies now!
-1	P5> PMC regulations prohibits the destruction of vital supplies by disabled vessels!
-1	P3> Bringing cargo on board... refueling coolant channels... installing radioactives in core... primary power levels coming up to stable. Commencing full repairs...
-1	P1> We can play "punt the snarf", Bob.
-1	P5> No-one will be snarf punting until we get home.
-1	P4> We can't let them go empty handed after helping us.
-1	P2> How about letting them go without blasting them...
-1	P1> Hey, how about we give them a glyptic scythe.
-1	P3> What possible use could they have for that?
-1	P4> They can have lots of fun with it. I know those silent guys do.
-1	P1> I'll just pop it _out the cargo doors...
-1	(Eng: Cargo received, glyptic scythe.)
-1	P6> (whispering) Thank you greatly for your help.

1       Peace and special somethings. We are the ^Four^. We are the ^Tetrad^. We are the ^Quai Pa'loi^.
2       Allow us to scrape and kneel as you leave us. We are merely the Four.
3       We are helpless.
5       We pray to the void. We look into the sea of stars and see emerald green island skies. We all dwell in the sky... The comfort of cold space, and the void.
6       Fishes in the sea. We see them and they comfort me. I am a pale blue globe that humbly grumbles in the meander gray.
7       Legs and eyes! Legs and eyes! They view us from the many misguided. Tapered ends and tampered tools. The bugs are among us!
8       We give the takers taking fruitless gestures. In agony the Four reach out and bite the hand that feeds them?
9       Madness! Even the bootless Four cannot pretend to comprehend the ramblings of the Moch.
10      Into what glassy pram do I sense this fist of anger? I am taken... We are baking. Fried of brine and gender.
11      Look into the out of for the Four. We are the Tetrad. All things begin and end. The beginning is one. The end is another. Two things happen while we wait. All is the Four.
12      Angst! Do not mention the dissent that draws us nearer to the edge. We nearly drop and fall. Oh... but wait. We claim and regroup. We must maintain the Four in spite of our shelves.
13      Give Us... give us... give to us that we might be more than Four. Ah, but wait. There is no more than Four. No less than Eight... We incorporate and are made whole.
14      Script a wordless play in acting. The hand it writes retracing. Within the word is word more still. Do not deny that you have seen it. It is within us all.
15      Seers who seek before the sight is seen.
16      Who? We have not tasted them.
17      A foreign flavor. A bit like laughing...
18      A goolas in disguise. A second hand reprise. A skillet with no eyes? Nay, I say freely.
19      No.
20      May we shriek? I think yes. I cannot take this monster that pervades my dreams. Visions.
20      The child.
24      Robed. They hold the key to a door we have not seen.
27      They hold the door to a key we have not seen.
31      The door.
32      The key.

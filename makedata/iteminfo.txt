1000
Single phase low level
energy weapon.



1001
Dual phase intermediate
level energy weapon.



1002
Improvements in plasma
containment allow for this
dual phase high energy
weapon.

1003
Multiphase high energy
laser weapon.



1004
Coupling charged trans-
formers, we got this
energy bolt weapon.


1005
Adding a third module to
the original design, we
arrived at this powerful
energy bolt weapon.

1006
Connecting several energy
bolts in sequence, this
weapon lashes madly at
nearby objects.

1007
A simple low impact missile
delivery system.



1008
Self tracking delivery
system with an extended
range capable of greater 
damages.

1009 
Heavy duty multiheaded
self tracking missile
delivery system.


1010
As powerful as the
ballista this system has
even greater range and
delivers more damage.

1011
Capable of firing in
salvos this monster of a
missile battery is both
fast and efficient.

1012
Smart bombs that are
nearly undetectable
because of their organic 
nature.

1013
A unique missile delivery
system which generates its
own projectiles.


1014
Sacrificing power for
stealth, caltrops are more
powerful than but easier to 
detect than tnglor eggs.

1015
An awesome array of missile
delivery systems capable of
ripping the life from most
targets.

1016
Tnglor eggs given a limited
intelligence that will track
targets until one or the 
other is destroyed.

1017
Utilizing id technology we
created this mind warping
nasty.


1018
A powerful missile
launcher that arms its
projectiles with variable
mass singularities.

1019
Incorporating id technology
and tnglor egg hardware
we got these seething
psychic nightmares.

1020
Using psychometric break-
throughs we were able to
create this psychic force
weapon. 

1021
Using the "tuning fork"
technique we were able to
set up psychic resonance in
the blast area.

1022
The blast from this psychic
weapon is such that it
renders all unshielded life
forms insane.

1023
This weapon completely
destroys the thoughts of all
but the most heavily
shielded minds.

1024
Named for the great noise it
makes, this missile launcher
is one of the most impress-
ive in its class. 

1025
After an accident in the lab
we came up with this strange
device.  It corrupts nucleic
stability in its target.

1026
Improving on the original
device, this allows two of
them to be mounted from the
same power source.

1027
Packing both the flux
conduit and the generator
into the dual raizor we get
this massive weapon.

1028
Converting one of the burnt
coils from the engine we
were able to create this
particle sling.

1029
Revamping the old tech from
the engine coils we improved
both the engine and the 
guerrloid design.

1030
Channeling surplus material
from the engines to the
guerrloid we doubled the
power output in this design.

1031
A final tweaking of the
guerrloid particle sling
resulted in this beauty.
Mean, mean, mean!!

1032
Capable of bidirectional
fire and multiphase psycho-
force bolts. 


1033
Pulling from shield tech-
nology this impressive
weapon sends out a moving
null shield blast.

1034
An impressive mass driven
weapon which warps the
space time around its 
target.

1035
A psychokinetic energy
weapon which lobs wads of
dense ego at its target
annihilating affected minds.

1036
Combining all aspects of
psychokinetics and wave 
driven ballistics this 
weapon is as yet, unmatched.

1037
Further improvements on mine
technology have allowed us
to create these vicious 
psycho-smart bombs. 

1038
This device is proof that
entropic resonance can,
in fact, be set up in ship
hulls; if they are hostile!

1039
After tampering with the
biomechanics of a nasty
bug one of the probes
snatched we got this.

1040
This fine piece of
machinery is the final
word in guerrloid
technology.

1041
And you thought mines could
not possibly get more
sinister.


1042
We stole a little Sengzhac
technology to bring you this
beautiful piece of work.


1043
We improved upon the
previous design, adding
even more damage to an
already powerful weapon.

1044
The name says it all.
Handle with care.



1045
The latest in psychothermic
technology.  It cost us
hours of lab repair but
it's finally complete.

1046
If it has a mind or a body
this device should dispose
of both efficiently...


1047
All we know is that when we
activate it massive objects
disappear.


1048
By implementing a magnetic
rifling affect we increased
the power of preexisting 
multiphase laser devices.

1049
Love thine enemy.  Kiss 'em
with this.



1050
Battery firing salvo ready
chained wave weapon.

counterpart, this device
causes affected material
to transmute.

1052

an artifact we discovered,
we thought you might find
it interesting.

1053
Cast your enemy down.
Exudate them with this
delightfully destructive
device.

1054
We've stopped trying to
understand Titarian tech-
nology, but here's a taste
of it.

1055
Shafts of golden fury fly
effortlessly from this
fierce fighting machine.


1056
Mass in 3-space dislikes
being crammed into 2-space.
This does it anyway.


1501
Steoplast plating with a
mirrored overlay combine to
repel low level energy
blasts.

1502
Four smaller shields which
overlap to create a tight
defense perimeter.


1503
Wave engines alternate,
pulsing every femtosecond
to provide maximum coverage
for minimal power usage.

1504
By adding a third wave 
engine to the binary design
shielding is quadrupled.


1505
A dense flux projection
created by multiple
particle beams powered by
a hybrid wave engine.

1506
Incorporating the wave
engine and uncertainty
field technology we got this
powerful sphere of force.

1507
Coupling the stasis
generator with force nodes
shoves incoming fire
into alternate space.

1508
By including id technology
with existing stasis devices
we were able to increase 
defense to psychic attacks.

1509
We designed this using parts
from an artifact we found.
We don't know how it works,
but it does the job.

1510
Learning more about the
terminex projection device
we improved its design.
Very, very nice.

1511
We believe an artifact is
using some sort of reality
engine. We tapped into it
and got this. Interesting.

1512
We understand the physics
behind the artifact now.
This device localizes and
nullifies entropy. Amazing.

1513
This is the final product of
artifact technology. It
creates a virtually impreg-
nable field of uncertainty.

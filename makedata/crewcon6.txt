1       Something concerns you?
1       Tell me what you wish to know.
1       A question plagues you?
1       My ^Leige^?
2       Peace.
2       Return if you need me.
2       Remember, I am here at your disposal.
3       We all feel helpless at times.
5       These creatures defy cell theory. They have developed entirely independent of conventional evolutionary paths. I suggest we query them on this matter when next we meet.
6       The cypher key that the D'pahk sent to us in their first communique includes a brief breakdown of their socio-political and genetic structures. They evolved in the torrid depths of the oceans on their watery homeworld zyoth. They developed as
6       bottom feeders. An entity that roughly translates as "The Sun" has had a significant effect on their development, but, as of yet, I haven't been able to determine what this term is in reference to.
7       Bugs... kept referring to themselves as I and me... Must function as part of a collective consciousness... This is very interesting. I'll talk to @1 to see if there are other things we can determine from the cypher key. What could they
7       Mean, "We already destroyed you."
8       I haven't checked the cypher key they sent or the vid link from the original transmission. Check with one of the other officers about them.
9       Could the cypher key have been scrambled upon transmission? That is the only way that i can explain the strange conversation we had with them during first contact. It might be a good idea to ask the void dwellers if they have encounter the Moch.
9       If so, they might have some insight into this madness.
10      I talked to those in engineering and security and they expressed concern over the unusually high strengths of ermigen shields during first contact. I quelled their suspicions after I had a look at the cypher key... Seems they developed with
10      little or no natural defenses on a hostile homeworld. As a result they constantly suspect alien races of conspiracy.
11      I skimmed through the cypher key and as I understand it to them the number four bears religious significance. I'll see if their is a clinical connection but for now I've no opinion of them yet to weight my evaluation.
14      The one race with whom we need to speak has neither communication access away from the homeworld nor a spoken language. I'm worried that even if we could find them the computer may not be able to generate a cypher key.
15      The Titerian have an interesting makeup. It seems that those with status possess fist-sized cyberimplants. I'm not sure what the purpose of these is yet. When we encounter them again I'll be sure run another analysis.
16      What puzzles me is how the guild could have completely destroyed a race. In any war there are always some survivors. How could it be that not a single viable member was left for retrocloning after the accident?
17      They are masterpieces of genetomechanical engineering. From my perspective they are works of art... Albeit, very vicious works of art.
18      I wasn't able to get anything from the cypher key. In the scramble to evade them most of the crucial data was lost. Besides, there is little that i could tell you which you don't already know about them. They want to eliminate us... What else
18      do we need to know?
23      Try asking one of the other officers about that. If I'm not mistaken @3 knows quite a bit about them.
24      I haven't checked the references in the cyper keys concerning them. In fact, if you find anything interesting about them let me know.
26      What could I have that you wish?
27      I know I shouldn't speak of such things, but their acts are like those of our old flesh. The acts of the third world... The third planet. So much death for so many unfounded reasons. May the powers that be have mercy on their souls.
28      I've been considering the repercussions of a supernova on the ship. The chances of it occurring are scant i know, but we may live a thousand lifetimes before we are ^flesh^ again. Probability is like a thief in the night.
28      The improbable comes when it is least expected. It would put my heart at ease to know that we had taken some precaution against such a catastrophic event. At least speak with @2 and @5 about it.
29      When I was ^flesh^ I remember picking up some info about the shunt drive in the ^Ttek^ valley. Seems the theories were considered little more than black magic. It amazes me how much theocracies can muddle certain sects of scientific research.
29      Those I spoke with suspected the shunt process to be linked with entropic exponentiation. That's all I know.
30      The concepts behind it are totally alien to me. Yes, I agree that I should've done more of my homework in psiops training, but I didn't actually think I'd have to use what they were teaching. Sorry I can't help.
31      I've skimmed the cypher keys from the races that have mentioned it. It is feared, worshipped and sometimes both by those who know it exists, but no one seems to agree as to its function or its beginning.
33      I believe that @2 has been working on the design of that material. They tell me it has strange thermal properties. Aside from that, I know little else.
34      Big ship... Great shields... Goes fast... The ermigen built it.  What of it?
36      That is your title, my Lord.
37      The blue ^albatross^ is the ^symbol^ of ^birth^. The ^martyrs^ of the Purgation ^Trials^ took on the symbol as their own. As a result the members of the ironseed movement continued and uplifted its use. It is now a holy symbol.
38      During the previous century ^synths^ and ^constructs^ finally replaced humans beings as the work force. The ruling class treated the synths like slaves and rationalized such cruel behavior by saying that the synths had no souls.
38      In order to eliminate opposition to this obviously despotic view the ruling class staged a series of "^incidents^" which ruined the position of the synth-sympathizers. They were branded as dangerous and subsequently ^tried^ and ^jailed^ en mass.
39      These were the brave souls who had all of their personality code erased scrambled or recompiled.
40      ^Legend^ has it that the first ^drop colony^ ship was called the albatross. Life, the spirit, it comes from water. Since both the albatross and water were life bringers the two were eventually made synonymous in theological terms.
41      Gradually as they were used for more complex tasks they were designed with more and more sophisticated personalities. Eventually they were capable of self awareness and the inevitable question was asked, "Are they alive?"
41      The ruling class suppressed such politically damaging questions with their answer, on the basis that nothing man-made can be infused with life. Constructs had no souls.
42      Drop ships were the colony ships that were used during the ^exodus^ when the ^old world^ passed away. They took us from the rotting bosom of the ^third planet^ and flew us on the wings of the albatross to the red world, Mars.
43      Almost two thousand years ago humankind was judged. The righteous were taken on the wings of the albatross to the red world. The third world is now a dead stone in space, lifeless. We speak of it only in hushed tones.
43      Its name is the name of iniquity, to speak it is to speak ^blasphemy^.
44      Hold your tongue! Such things are forbidden. That is the name of iniquity. Do not speak it again unless you wish to incur the ^wrath^ of the ^almighty^.
45      There is no flesh on board for a medic to care for. Instead, I am in charge of the digital equivalent. I am responsible for maintaining personality backups, mission records, and overall data integrity.
45      Let me know if there is a subject I can assist you with.
46      @6.
47      Remember the proverb about the seed?
48      You are the Laird of this ship.
49      Anger is not a subject of which i wish to speak.
50      Power corrupts... absolute power? Well, omniscience blackens even the heart of god.
51      A planet, like many others... A red stone orbiting a lonely star. Any planet would please me now, had it only air and water to drink.
52      Foreign... estranged.
53      Others know about such things... I prefer not to express my views. It's much safer that way.
54      We are now just bits of information... A series of ons and offs in a personality containment device. How can we even be sure that we are here at all?
55      While I am in an eternal search for answers, for the truth about things like this, I don't like discussing my views with others. I don't believe my own opinion to be concrete enough to be relevant or of interest to you.
56      You as laird and archon are kept in prime encode storage, free from psychomanipulation and data errors. Consider yourself lucky.
57      Many things have happened in my lifetime to make me distrust and dislike the ^Ttek^ priesthood and council. The twisted methods they used to convict "criminals against the state" was the last straw. I have no respect for them now, and abhor them.
57      Then again, I suppose it matters little here... The entire situation thousands of years and trillions of miles away.
58      Faith in a cause is sometimes all that is needed to give a soul the incentive to sacrifice himself. Don't you agree?

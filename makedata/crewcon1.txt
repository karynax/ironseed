1       What is the matter you wish to discuss?
1       My ^Leige^, What is the topic that concerns you?
1       ^Laird^, What can I ^help^ you with?
1       My ^Leige^?
2       Glad to ^help^ you.
2       ...And a good bye to you too.
2       Until we speak again.
2       May you go with the ^albatross^.
5       Fascinating creatures, are they not? if I hadn't seen them with my own sensory array I wouldn't have believed it. How do you think these strange beings evolved? To live so long they have evolved so slowly. Amazing.
6       I have done my own analysis of these creatures, but the data were ^inconclusive^. For some reason I was unable to get an accurate ^reading^ of their esper level or disposition. They must have been ^jamming^ us with some kind of psychic ^shield^.
7       They appear to have a hive mentality. By some quirk of evolution no single being has self awareness. Only the total of all sengzhac, the oversoul if you will, possesses an intellect.
7       This is why the computer interpreted sociocentric references as I and me.
87      Details of the Sengzhac from the second bouy are vague except that the wrecked ship was being harried by them.
8       This race seems to have based its entire existence around trade, and, though no form of universal currency exists, credit with the Guild is respected by the imperial races we've encountered.
9       I find it difficult to believe that a star faring race could have evolved from such a motley crew of psychopaths. Each suffers from an acute case of multiple personality disorder.
10      My first psychoanalysis of these creatures and their behaviors has revealed little. Their ship designs suggest an innate paranoia, but they have little or no aura which makes dispositional evaluations inaccurate at best.
11      Religious associations with the number three in the human culture developed primarily from the arabic fascination with pi. I wonder - could the Quai Pa'loi tetrad have mathematics background?
14      To have evolved with only a written language... Social structures evolving without distance signaling? The chances for such an occurrence are improbable at best. I would appreciate it if you could get me more data concerning them.
15      Highly advanced. They have a peculiar psychic signature which suggests special abilities I do not yet comprehend. I will contact you as soon as I know more.
16      Completely annihilated. This must weigh heavily on the minds of the Guild.
17      These must be the product of some nightmarish experimentation. Self-affective evolution... Pity we don't possess the same ability.
18      Xenomorphic in both biology and psychology. Their psychic signature changes with their form. I didn't think it was possible to change the aura of a living thing without mechanical augmentation. Hmm... I was obviously mistaken.
23      Try asking one of the other officers about the trojan gate point theories.
24      Strange to think that these beings hold so much sway over such diverse species. I wish we could meet so that I could scan and observe them.
25      I lower my head in ^prayer^. Someday we will have a home. Until that day, I weep.
26      I have nothing to offer you which you do not already have.
27      A truly bizarre ritual. I only wish I knew more about them and why they would go to such extremes to honor these... ^monks^.
28      That would be a subject of interest to @3 and @4. They both seem to have a keen interest in stellar phenomenon.
29      You would find that @2 knows much more about that subject than I.
30      While I have an obvious interest as to how psychoengineering could produce such a thing as the phase drive, the practicality of using such a device if it could even be built is a draw back which leads me to believe we will live a long time.
31      The name itself has powerful philosophic connotations. Look through God's Eye to find knowledge... To find paradise... Concepts which drive every sentient being.
31      Perhaps we will find a habitable planet on the other side, one we can claim for ourselves. Our own brave new world... I can only hope.
32      That is the _name of this great ship in which we now travel.
33      Isn't that some kind of heat resistant material? I know little about such things. I would ask @2 for a complete description of it.
36      That is your title, my Lord.
37      The blue ^albatross^ is the ^symbol^ of ^birth^. The ^martyrs^ of the ^purgation^ ^Trials^ took on the ^symbol^ as their own. As a result the members of the ironseed ^movement^ continued and uplifted its use. It is now a holy symbol.
38      During the previous century ^synths^ and ^constructs^ finally replaced humans beings as the work force. The ruling class treated the ^synths^ like slaves and rationalized such cruel behavior by saying that the ^synths^ had no souls.
38      In order to eliminate opposition to this obviously despotic view the ruling class staged a series of "incidents" which ruined the position of the ^synth^-^sympathizers^. They were branded as dangerous and subsequently tried and jailed en mass.
39      These were the brave souls who had all of their personality code ^erased^, scrambled or recompiled.
40      ^Legend^ has it that the first ^drop colony^ ship was called the ^albatross^. Life, the spirit, it comes from water. Since both the ^albatross^ and water were life bringers the two were eventually made synonymous in theological terms.
41      Synth is a contraction of the term synthetic, more appropriately, synthetic organism. ^Constructs^, as they are also called, were originally created by the ^Ttek^ priests for mindless tasks.
41      Gradually as they were used for more complex tasks they were designed with more and more sophisticated personalities. Eventually they were capable of self awareness and the inevitable question was asked, "Are they alive?"
41      The ruling class suppressed such politically damaging questions with their answer, on the basis that nothing man-made can be infused with life. ^Constructs^ had no souls.
42      Drop ships were the colony ships that were used during the ^exodus^ when the ^old world^ passed away. They took us from the rotting bosom of the ^third planet^ and flew us on the wings of the ^albatross^ to the red world, Mars.
43      Almost two thousand years ago humankind was judged. The righteous were taken on the wings of the ^albatross^ to the red world. The third world is now a dead stone in space, lifeless. We speak of it only in hushed tones.
43      Its name is the name of iniquity, to speak it is to speak ^blasphemy^.
44      Hold your tongue! Such things are ^forbidden^. That is the name of iniquity. Do not speak it again unless you wish to incur the ^wrath^ of the ^almighty^.
45      It is my purpose to provide you with psychological evaluations of both crew and encountered species. If you have any specific questions concerning either feel free to ask me.
46      I am @1, currently appointed psychometrist to the space faring vessel, ^Ironseed^.
47      Iron is the seed from which man sprang and the root to which we now cling.
48      The development of ^tools^ heralded the ^birth^ of man as a thinking machine. The discovery of iron was the seed which ensured the stability of the development of the tool. Man sprang from the seed - the Ironseed.
49      By virtue of the ^tool^ we have this great ship, Ironseed, in which to travel. She is a mighty vessel, is she not?
50      All things, beginning with ^iron^, are tools.
51      You are the Laird, Archon, Master and Lord of this ship and its crew.
52      The sanity levels of the crew can be analyzed and adjusted through my face of the ^command cube^.
53      The command cube, which you will find on the main screen, is the interface through which the actions of the crew can be organized.
54      We are the ^tools^ of our god, and it is our purpose to serve. Our god is a vengeful god. Useless and insolent tools will be thrown back into the flame of the ^soul forge^.
55      All souls are wrought from the holy fire of the soul forge.
56      Perhaps one day our children will see the rising of her sun, but for us no such fortune is possible. We may never return.
57      Many things are alien to us.
58      It saddens me. We were stripped of our ^flesh^ to escape imprisonment. Stored as encodes, the whole of our experiences and memories in the belly of the Ironseed.
59      You, ^Laird^, are the prime encode aboard this vessel.
60      To legitimize the ^Trials^ many of those tried were framed for crimes unrelated to the ^movement^. These crimes were then linked to the ^underground^ and because of political prejudice the defendant would have no chance to win the case.
61      The most proliferant of these Ttek priests were members of a council which arbitrated the morality and use of ^tools^.
62      I pride my self on my knowledge of our philosophies and history... Feel free to ask me about any related subjects.
63      Speaking of the old world... of the third world... Such things are forbidden. They infuriate the great keeper of tools who is our god.
64      Had I knees, I would kneel. I cannot pray enough for the time that I might return to my ^flesh^.
65      Above all things I fear erasure most. To die, to be erased without backup is inconceivably horrible. You would... Cease to exist.
66      The D'pahk have no perceivable reason for using such a shield which is why I have questioned my results. Further speculation will have to wait until we encounter them again.
67      My previous suspicions have proven correct. The D'pahk are using a force nine psychic barrier. The strength of the shield is either the result of extreme paranoia on the part of a peaceful race or a deceitful attempt to mask their true intent.

-1	While performing their duties the crew can become stressed. Performing research exacerbates this due to fact it eats away at all spare time. High levels _of stress will erode the mental welfare _of encode.

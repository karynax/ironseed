1       Welcome to our world. We rejoice that you have chosen to speak with us. We always believed that you would ^come^ to us.
1       Greetings, we knew that you would ^come^. We have been waiting for such a long time.
1       News of your ^coming^ has awakened us from a deep sleep, and now we ready to greet you.
1       Hello, we have ^expected^ you. We are ready now to welcome you among us.
2       The only help we ask of you is forgiveness for our unfaithfulness.
2       We know that you have always helped us and we are thankful for your blessings.
2       You bless us so much already... How could you help us more than you already have?
2       We are undeserving of your help and your mercy.
3       We are well, and have prepared to serve you.
3       In the midst of our famines and plagues, we have still kept your faith.
3       Can we ever be in a better state than we are now here with you in our midst?
3       Our purpose is to serve you.
4       Our world is fertile and pleasant.
4       This world you have given us meets all of our needs and wants.
4       Our world is barren and it is hard for us to meet our needs, but we still keep your faith.
4       We know that this world is merely a test for us, and that we will be allowed to enter your world after your coming.
5       Yes, we have an offering for you.
6       They were burned. Our faith and actions are now justified.
7       They have never lied to us before.
7       We trust in them as we trust in you.
7       They are old and wise. We have listened long and expected long.
7       Our faith in them has finally been justified. We are finally triumphant over the ^unbelievers^.
8       We do not understand your reference.
8       Yes, we will continue to plant the seeds of your faith.
8       The seeds of knowledge will be planted here for many eons to come.
8       We have not yet found it, but we will continue our search until we do.
9       Yes, in our ^legends^, you were ^predestined^ to walk among us... Finally here in your physical form.
9       Yes, the ^stars^ ^predicted^ your coming. We saw your appearance there many ages ago.
9       Your ^prophets^ have been announcing your appearance for many chrons.
9       The ^oracle^ foretold your arrival. Of course, we believed and waited for you.
10      We will be waiting for your return, oh fair one.
10      Please, do not part from us yet! We still have more to learn from you.
10      Depart if you must. We will be patient for your return.

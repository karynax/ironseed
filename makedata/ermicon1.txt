1       Welcome. We are the ermigen. I am sure that you have heard of us. In all rudeness, I must assume that you have come here to ^grovel^ before us.
3       Good bye, little ones. Any inconvienience we are about to cause you is unfortunate. We hope our show of strength and wisdom has abated your worries.
5       From the time we crawled from the sea we knew them. They came to us when we were in caves. They spoke to our seers. They taught us the use of tools. we welcome them.
6       We have never trusted them... The legends speak of them landing in our oceans and poisoning the water. They melted our ice caps.
6       Out of kindness we allowed them passage into the kendar. They repay our generosity by dividing the kendar with their lies. What we worked so hard to create they destroyed without the slightest hint of remorse.
7       We have stories of sengzhac covering our world in a death swarm. Our skies darkened from their form. Our broken bodies in burning heaps... I am sure that you can imagine it.
8       We find the guild useful. There are a great _many things that they provide us. In exchange we provide them protection. With fire we protect them... Our great cargan to escort their precious cargos. We are strong.
9       Lunatics... I am certain they are hiding something... They hide themselves in their madness, and plot. They could snuff the life from us all. Be wary and watch yourself.
10      Don't bother asking us about ourselves... our arms, our strength is justified. That is all you need know.
11      They have never offended us. They have never agressed. We do not know them. Surely they cannot have strength if we do not know them.
14      They are worthy of trust. They were not a part of the kendar and have never offended us. Surely, they respect our strength.
15      Minds corrupted by implantation... Surely they are insane.
16      We do not know of them.
17      Interesting creatures. They have no original self. They absorb the others to form themselves. There is no honor in that. They have no inherent strength. Vile parasites.
23      We are not sure how the trojan gates operate or what they do. We do know that there exists a gate in operation at (1.9,127.1,88.1). You could learn more from the icon.
24      What happened to them? They inhabited the Papesian system but vanished mysteriously.
26      We have nothing to give you. We require all of our goods for our strength.
27      How terrible... there are those among us who follow the papesian monks. Sensless death, I say! Since the glorious defeat of the ^Dark Kind^ the monks have led sects of all races to believe that they would return. Madness!
31      The Sengzhac claim it is but a stone. We know that there is more to it. 
32      We know not what you mean...
34      It is our fist.  Without it, we would have no strength.
36      Groveling will not help. No amount of begging will prevent the ^destruction^ of your ^planet^. It does not concern us. You must understand that we cannot change our minds. It will be destroyed.
37      It is not difficult to comprehend the necessity of the destruction. It is all for the best.
38      There are _many on the ^terminal agenda^. The destruction of your particular celestial object is inconvenient to you. We realize this but that is one of the unfortunate consequences of choosing to inhabit a planet in a restricted area.
39      It is not appropriate to ask the strong about ^fear^.
40      The terminal agenda is the list of objects that must be removed from ^restriced areas^. We are the strong. Therefore, we are ^designated^ to ^remove^.
41      As you should know, dense star clusters behave unpredictably. Suns within these clusters often go into a state of orbital instability. systems that are likely to experience this instability are tagged as restricted areas. The ^stability council^
41      reviews such cases. They decide what should be done. Often the solution is planetary annhilation at a ^critical moment^ in order to restabalize the system. Systems with ^gates^ are often
41      more likely to become instable than their neighboring systems.
42      we completely comprise the ^council^. We decide who removes the object. Because we are strong choose ourselves to carry out the removal.
43      The council meets whenever one of the restricted areas becomes unstable. We decide what should be done about the ^instability^.
44      The destruction has to be timed properly to assure the best chance of restoring instability. If instability is not restored we destroy another object. That would be unfortunate.
45      If the system remains unstable, planetary orbits deteriorate and change the natural climates of all the planets in the system. This would be disasterous to all of the races living in the system. It is much
45      better to destroy one than to let them all be destroyed.
45      Some say that the ^gates^ are responsible for these instabilities. We have no opinion regarding this. We merely correct what is wrong.
46      I tell you, we fear ^nothing^!
47      Are we not strong? You should not concern yourself with our fears. They are ^minor^.
48      I tell you it is not important for you to know our fears! Though they are ^many^ they are insignificant. You have no need to know our fears.
50      I submit! We are afraid of almost ^everything^. When we know that the others ^plot^ our ^extinction^ we have good ^reason^ to fear.
51      Yes, everything... Sengzhac, Derraak, creatures from Obetai, the white tempreth, the ^gates^... If it can be named, it can be feared. Our strength absolves our fear. If we are strong then we have no reason to fear.
51      We have ^protection^. Our arms are justified. Our strength is real. Our fears are insignificant. We are ermigen.
52      From the time of the kendar the others have envied the ermigen. They envy our strength. They envy our cunning. We brought together the others as the kendar and now they disgrace us. They backstab, and wish us dead. They have no honor.
53      We have the ^cargan^. It is the most ^powerful^ ship ever built. Protected by a ^temporal anchor^, it can withstand any attacks from the others.
54      The weapons on the cargan are not powerful... But the shielding is. We have developed the most advance shields. Our ships are better defended than any of the others.
55      The most powerful shield ever created. It requires massive amounts of energy, but... the security and peace of mind is worth it.

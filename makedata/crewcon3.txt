1       My Laird, What matters concern you?
1       What matters would you like to discuss?
1       What would you like to ask me about?
1       Is there something i can help you with, my Leige?
2       Fare thee well.
2       Come again if you have questions.
2       Let me know if i can be _of further assistance.
2       Until we speak again.
2       Peace.
5       Nebulas _of dust and gas held together by weak magnetic forces. Their interbody communication or nervous system, as it were, is comprised _of resonant energies... Ambient magnetic force, left over from the big bang.
5       I can make only vague speculations as to their method _of reproduction and the culture is also a mystery. The cypher key they transmitted was structured so well that it required almost no translation. It is as if they already knew our language.
6       According to their cypher key they are ocean dwelling bottom feeders, which share a number _of similarities to the cnidarian class _of invertebrates having a single, internal digestive cavity, protruding stinger cells and a simple nervous system.
6       Through the course _of many generations they have made up for their simple neural structure by developing multiple nervous systems which function in parallel. This is reflected in their overall behavior... As well as their ship design.
7       These hideous creatures are as their appearance suggests identical to our arachnid, a class _of invertebrate anthropods, having simple eye arrays, no antennae or wings, and whose diet consists _of the bodily fluids _of their prey.
7       Interestingly enough a single body is no bigger than a small dog. The danger comes in their numbers.
7       Their cypher key hints at a hive oriented ancestry. As they developed more complex and inter woven social structures the individuals lost whatever self awareness they may have possessed.
7       As this devolutionary process took over the hive, or collective, continued to _evolve... Eventually to self awareness.
8       They structured their cypher key in such a way as to mask all references to culture and social structures. The cypher did, however, include a full breakdown _of rates _of exchange and barter for the last thousand years.
8       Corporatists through and through.
9       I'm not sure what to say.
9       I have read the cypher key... But some _of the references were, well, strange. I found things like vessel and fruit bat cross linked. I believe them to be deeply disturbed.
10      I definitely need to do my homework... I have yet to read the cypher key. Let me do that... Come back in a few days and I'll give you a full analysis.
11      For some strange reason they developed a deeply rooted value _of the number four. I've been discussing related issues with @6. When we have completed our analysis I'll be sure to get back to you on it.
14      They do not speak? I would have thought a race ^incapable^ _of developing a language such as this. Phrases and subtlety _of speech, all woven as threads. Such a thing is not possible. They could not have ^evolved^ naturally.
15      I wasn't able to perform a complete analysis _of them... However, @6 did complete a thorough scan. I would ask them about it.
16      I don't have enough information to give you a full description. Let me gather more data and I'll get back to you on that subject when my information is more complete.
17      Fully automated self-affective artificial intelligences... Made by whom... For what purpose? I find it difficult to believe that they could have _evolved independently.
18      Omnivorous xenomorphs. Flowing freely from one form to another, they don't appear to have a source form. Perhaps they are born without form... I wonder. Regardless _of their origins they are vicious and territorial. I suggest we avoid them.
23      The trojan gates function very similar in concept to the shunt drive. The main difference is that the trojan gate requires several orders _of magnitude less power to activate.
23      The trade off is that the target location for a trojan gate must be a gravity well or a trojan point.
24      Strange beings they must be... I have read little about them in the cypher keys, but I know enough to wonder... To wonder who they must be.
25      Don't speak to me _of sol. I miss the days _of flesh and long to return to a living body.
26      You wish something from me, Laird?
27      I haven't read the references to that subject in the cypher key.
28      The last stage in a star's life. Massive stars eventually reach a point where the mass _of the star is greater than the expansive force inside the star. This causes the star to implode and subsequently explode.
28      The resulting explosion is so intense it can be easily detected in other galaxies.
29      The shunt drive is a device which transports a target mass from a point in space-time to another point in space-time using hyperspatial mass translation.
29      Current theories state that a shunt may only be opened if their is sufficient localized probability stemming, or contained entropy. A shunt, if it could be built, would work best in a star. But _of course, that is if it could be built...
30      I'm not qualified to give you an accurate explanation _of the theories. I would ask @1 about that.
31      The iron stone that the D'pahk would have us find. I wonder what is on the other side.
32      That is the name _of our vessel.
33      A heat retardant carbidium composite supplanted with kinetic dispersion nodules.
36      That is your title, my Lord.
37      The blue ^albatross^ is the ^symbol^ _of ^birth^. The ^martyrs^ _of the Purgation ^Trials^ took on the symbol as their own. As a result the members _of the ironseed movement continued and uplifted its use. It is now a holy symbol.
38      During the previous century ^synths^ and ^constructs^ finally replaced humans beings as the work force. The ruling class treated the synths like slaves and rationalized such cruel behavior by saying that the synths had no souls.
38      In order to eliminate opposition to this obviously despotic view the ruling class staged a series _of "incidents" which ruined the position _of the synth-sympathizers. They were branded as dangerous and subsequently ^tried^ and ^jailed^ en mass.
39      These were the brave ^souls^ who had all _of their personality code erased scrambled or recompiled.
40      ^Legend^ has it that the first ^drop colony^ ship was called the albatross. Life, the spirit, it comes from water. Since both the albatross and water were life bringers the two were eventually made synonymous in theological terms.
41      Synth is a contraction _of the term synthetic, more appropriately, synthetic organism. Constructs, as they are also called, were originally created by the Ttek priests for mindless tasks.
41      Gradually as they were used for more complex tasks they were designed with more and more sophisticated personalities. Eventually they were capable _of self awareness and the inevitable question was asked, "Are they alive?"
41      The ruling class suppressed such politically damaging questions with their answer, on the basis that nothing man-made can be infused with life. Constructs had no souls.
42      Drop ships were the colony ships that were used during the ^exodus^ when the ^old world^ passed away. They took us from the rotting bosom _of the ^third planet^ and flew us on the wings _of the albatross to the red world, Mars.
43      Almost two thousand years ago humankind was judged. The righteous were taken on the wings _of the albatross to the red world. The third world is now a dead stone in space, lifeless. We speak _of it only in hushed tones.
43      Its name is the name _of iniquity, to speak it is to speak blasphemy.
44      Hold your tongue! Such things are forbidden. That is the name _of iniquity. Do not speak it again unless you wish to incur the ^wrath^ _of the ^almighty^.
45      Probability won't allow for the number _of strange and unexplained evolutions that we've seen the product of. Something very ancient must have coordinated their creation. I wouldn't tell you this if I wasn't sure that I was correct.
45      You must realize that by saying this i'm putting my creditability on the line. you must believe me. I'm not sure what this means. My biggest worry is that this "ancient race" is somehow still influencing those it created.
46      As science officer, it is my duty to collect and analyze alien compounds and living specimens, and to use the acquired knowledge to assist you in better commanding the ship.
47      My name is @3, science officer for the ironseed, a ^CR-70 Class Mandrix Militial Explorer^.
48      I only know the class type... I would ask engineering for more detailed information.
49      Iron is an element consisting _of atoms having twenty protons and which weighs in at 55.85 atomic mass units. scientifically speaking it is a mundane material having no bizarre properties... _of course there is the Ttek definition _of iron.
50      To journey or to pass, as in through another country... or in our case, through another section _of the galaxy.
51      You were selected to be the Laird _of this vessel. That is your title.
52      Ttek teachings tell us that the creator, the ^Master of Tools^, is, while being judicious and virtuous, wrathful. We are told to ^fear^.
53      Fear, in my mind, is not the reason we should worship... If we are to worship at all. Respect should be our motivator. Unfortunately, the ignorant can only understand fear.
54      While I may know much about such things I prefer to keep my assistance scientific. If you wish to know more about the Ttek I would ask psychometry.
55      That was our homeworld... Red as the ^blood^ which is the life.
56      The blood is Red that flows through the ^veins^ _of our ^flesh^... when we still possessed it.
57      Once we were flesh and bone. When we still lived on mars our homeworld. I miss the flesh. The importance _of our cause is all that keeps me sane... And it is the only thing for which I would give up my body, as we all have.
58      It is my function to analyze that which is alien.
59      What is this thing, our soul?
60      Our memories and experiences are stored in the ships computer. We interact with the environment through a virtual interface. It has been given the look and feel _of a real world for sanity's sake.
61      You are the prime encode... You have been given priority because _of your position and as a result you are immune to the ^psychological^ ^malleability^ the rest _of us are prone to.
62      Memory errors and general stress on lower priority encodes sometimes make it necessary to adjust them using the psychometry functions on your ^cube^ ^command^ ^interface^.
63      The cube in the main interface contains the commands for accessing the many crew functions.
64      ^Horrible^ things were done to those who sympathized with the movement.
65      Staged crimes, blackballing and framing those involved were common ploys.
66      The purpose _of being is to understand. One acquires understanding through learning. To learn we must ask questions and to the religious, religion is the purpose _of being, therefore we must question religion if we are to be.
67      Hogwash!
68      I pray... In a manner _of speaking.
69      Someday we will have a home.

@-1	-1	3	100	ANOMALIES ANOMALY
100	When performing an anomaly scan I look for things that have been artifically made. I also look for surface deposits _of useful elements and compounds that can be easily retrieved.
100	After an anomaly scan is complete you can retrieve any found anomalies by pressing the anomaly button on the _planet scan screen then select the anomaly from the list _of found anomalies then press the retrieve button.

-1	It's a interesting piece of hardware and how it operates is quite fascinating. However I think you want to talk to engineering for the more practical discussion of its use.

@12      -1      1       93      HELP ADVICE
93	We need to scan and catalog as many planets as we can. It's the only way we can find a _world to make our new _home.
@11      -1      1       92      HELP ADVICE
92	We should travel to the nearby star that we found marked in the data bouy we found from the wreckage. Even if we don't find anything @5 should be able get an accurate bead on nearby stars with the use _of parallax.
@11	 -1	 1	 91	 WRECK WRECKAGE WRECKED
91	The wreck we found was mostly destroyed by the impact with the _planet but it does bare marks _of being attacked.
@10	 -1	 3	 90	 WRECK WRECKAGE WRECKED
@10      -1      3       90      HELP ADVICE
90	We need to send probes to investigate the wreckage. Perform this by choosing "_planet scan" from my face _of the command cube and doing a scan for anomalies. 
90	Only the anomaly scan needs to be completed but in the interest _of science I would like the other scan types finished. I also recommend retrieving any anomalies found as we have scant supplies.
@-1      -1      1       3       HELP ADVICE
3       We all feel helpless at times.
@-1	-1	1	-1	RESEARCH RESEARCHING
-1	Research is vital for learning how to build equipment for our ship and our would be colony.


@18	-1	3	-1	SUNDIVER SUNPROBE STARDIVER STARPROBE
-1	Heavily plating a convential probe in thermoplast opens up possibility to send probes to the surface _of a star for detailed analysis. It's even possible to send a probe beneath the surface for a limited time.
@-1	-1	3	-1	SUNDIVER SUNPROBE STARDIVER STARPROBE
-1	Being able to probe the surface and depths _of star is interesting from a science point _of view, but it's not something feasible with the resources _of the Ironseed.

@18	-1	3	-1	SUNMINER STARMINER
-1	The discovery _of thermoplast has opened up this idea. _Of course were not literally mining a star, as they're mostly helium and hydrogen with rapidly diminishing quanities _of more advance elements.
-1	What a starminer would do is harness the intense pressures, heat and energy output _of a star to synthesize advance elements.
@-1	-1	3	-1	SUNMINER STARMINER
-1	Literally mining a star is a silly notion, as they're mostly helium and hydrogen with rapidly diminishing quanities _of more advance elements.
-1	However, there is some merit in the idea _of using the intense pressures, heat and energy output _of a star to synthesize advance elements.
-1	Of course you need to be able to make a lab that can withstand the surface _of a star.

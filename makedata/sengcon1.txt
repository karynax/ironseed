1       My ^limbs^ flex in anticipation of crushing you and drinking your ^fluids^. You cannot ^escape^.
2       Yes, it is time to finish this. My limbs swell in anticipation. Preform your death rituals. It is time to die.
3       Nothing can protect you from me...I am ^Sengzhac^.
7       That is who I am...the Guardian, the Collective, the Old One, the Keeper of Tales, the Drinker of Flesh, the Master of Harrag, the Eye Watcher, the Great U'gloit, and the Protector of the ^Peril^.
7       I have told you who I am, That you might know your devourer. Now, my spine is florid.. I grow impatient. You must die.
25      To know where I am... That would be a powerful weapon. But i fear no weapon possessed by the dead. (51.4,9.9,174.3). Let your spirit find Xamiu. now we fight.
26      Your fluids are all that interest me.
31      You should not have ventured there. All who approach God's Eye receive death. That is my way, and that is the way it must be.
31      I tire of your chirping. You have violated my space and for this there is no recompense. Prepare to die.
32      The Ironseed will never sprout... of that I am certain.
33      When you approached God's Eye, I confronted you. You escaped and I found you... Now I have found you again. You cannot run from me. I am ^Sengzhac^, the Guardian.
34      My limbs shall feast upon the vile compounds of your body. I will enjoy your fluids. I am sure that I will. Your fleshly appearance betrays the moisture within you.
34      There would be great ^peril^ were I to let you live. It is the ^peril^ which justifies my consumption.
35      There is no logic in running. My limbs are everywhere. You cannot escape me... I will find you. I am ^Sengzhac^.
36      The perils are ancient, but the risk is ever present. As the guardian, I must eliminate the risk for the rest.
37      My tentacles are everywhere...Spread throughout the quadrant. You will not escape me. I am ^Sengzhac^.
